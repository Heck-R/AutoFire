Contains some hotkeys to do automatic key/button mashing.  \
The hotkeys can be set at the top of the script.

Functionalities:
- **Held Auto Fire**: Rapid clicking while thr assigned key is being held down (this hotkey must only consist of one key without modifiers)  \
  Also turns off toggled auto fire in case it's on
- **Toggle Auto Fire**: Turn on/off rapid clicking
  - NOTE: Turning toggled rapid fire off with this hotkey is not reliable when modifiers are included in the hotkey (-> use `Held Auto Fire` then)
- **Set Auto Fire Key**: After triggering, press any key / mouse button / etc. to set it as the rapid fire key for `toggleAutoFire` and `heldAutoFire`
- **Hold Key Down**: After triggering, press any key / mouse button / etc. to keep it held down
